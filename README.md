# Group-Project-1-WebApp

# Description

This repository contains the files for our first group project for UT Bootcamp. This project was purposed to utilize all of the skills we have learned so far in html, css, and javascript combined with our knowledge of APIs to create a front-end, dynamic, web application. We also learned to work within the GitFlow by creating and resolving issues, managing a project board, making commits and feature branches and pull requests as a team. In addition, we used server side APIs to fetch data that the user can interact with and store onto local storage using javascript.

# How to Use

This is a random character generator for the role-playing game DnD (Dungeons & Dragons). Click the "Create" button and the input boxes will populate with a random name, race, class, and stats for you to use and save to the page! An image of the race of the character will also generate along with your character information. If you like the character you generated, press the "Save Character" button and the information will be stored on the browser for you even if you close out of the page and come back to it. You can save as many characters as you would like! If you have recorded the character information on your own character sheet and would like to reset the form, press the "Reset" button and start over!
